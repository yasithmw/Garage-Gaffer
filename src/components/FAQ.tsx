    q: "How do you vet your mechanics?",
    a: "Every mechanic on Garage Gaffer goes through a proper check-up before they take a single booking. We verify qualifications, confirm public liability insurance, run DBS background checks, and review work history. After that, your ratings and reviews do the rest — mechanics who consistently drop below 4.5 stars are removed from the platform.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does pricing work? Are there any hidden fees?",
    a: "Your quote is fully inclusive — parts, labour, VAT and the mechanic's call-out are all in one price. If your mechanic spots something unexpected on the day (say a worn brake disc during a pad change), they'll stop, explain what they've found, and get your approval before doing any extra work. You'll never get a surprise bill.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if something goes wrong after the job?",
    a: "Every job comes with a 12-month workmanship warranty, plus the manufacturer warranty on any new parts. If anything's not right, message us and we'll sort it — usually with a free return visit from your original mechanic. You're never on your own once the spanner is down.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a mobile mechanic void my manufacturer warranty?",
    a: "No — your servicing can be carried out by any qualified mechanic using the right parts, without affecting your warranty (it's a piece of EU law called Block Exemption). Our mechanics stamp your service book and keep a digital record, so your car's history is all neatly in one place.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where can the mechanic work on my car?",
    a: "Your driveway, the street outside your house, your office car park, a friend's place — anywhere with reasonable space and access. For some bigger jobs (like clutch replacements) we may need a flat surface and a bit more room; your mechanic will flag that when they accept the booking.",
